Starting a project, or the initiation phase is a specific process in the project lifecycle. Getting that process right is the first step in successfully managing any project. In this blog, I'll try to elaborate on why and how we can manage the project by tools.

After speak to my friend I decided to split each section with any posts.

There are many steps that every front-end developers and maintainers should know, they are:
 - [How to formatting codes](https://overafaik.com/formatting-codes)
 - [How to reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code](https://overafaik.com/linting-codes)
 - [How to check object types](https://overafaik.com/flow-type-check)
 - [How to test everything](https://overafaik.com/jest)
 - [How to build the project](https://overafaik.com/build-project)
 - [How to use CI](https://overafaik.com/continous-integration)
 - How forced contributors to staying on contributing guidelines?

Attention, To applying these steps you need to know about each of them. Don't worry! because I want to explain all of them.
